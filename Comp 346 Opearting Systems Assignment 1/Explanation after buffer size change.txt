The running times for the client and server threads seem to be almost same between the two cases,
with slight variations in the milliseconds. However, the main difference lies in the running time of the
network thread, which is slightly shorter in the case with the larger buffer size (20).

This difference can be attributed to the fact that with a larger buffer size, there is less competetion for
space in the network buffers. This means that transactions can be processed more efficiently, resulting in 
slightly shorter running times for both the client and server threads.

However, the difference in running time between the two buffer sizes is not significant. 

Increasing the buffer size can improve the performance of the network by reducing competetion and 
But the improvement may vary depending on the specific use case and system configuration.

One thing was noticed that with a buffer size of 100, the program seems to work very fast as there are 
enough space to fit 71 transactions at one time. On the other hand, a buffer size of 1 leads to a slower 
completion time. This indicates that by increasing space, we can improve on time. 

Overall, these changes also depend on the machine that the program is running on. A powerful machine 
should work faster than a weaker one. Hence these changes of time are very dependable on various factors.
